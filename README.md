# pico-fermi-bagel
[Game in C++ based on deductive reasoning]

Instructions:
The game starts with 30 points in your hand. The computer returns a random three digit number. 
Your sole job is to guess the number. You are given 15 chances and each time, you guess a three digit number.
Unfortunately you lose out on 2 points with every wrong guess. 
If one or more digits that you enter are correct and at the correct place, the game returns Fermi(F).
If one or more digits are correct but not at the correct place, the game returns Pico(P).
If none of the digits that you enter are correct, the game returns Bagel(B).
